\opening{Dear Sirs:}

I present my paper, \emph{International Capital Flows and Speculation}. I have used the framework presented by Hau and Rey (2006) to assess the effect of speculation on exchange rates.  There are a number of contributions that include: augmenting the model with speculative flows, measuring speculative flows and using a Structural Vector Autoregression model.  The results suggest that speculation has a significant effect on the real exchange rate, that equity flow is less important that other studies would suggest and that central bank intervention to affect the real exchange rate can be effective.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

I look forward to your reply. 

\closing{Yours faithfully,}
