The SVAR.tex paper is in the zip file to send to the journal. I am now working on the major corrections. 

These are the corrections and my response

Review 1:

1) Absttract is too short. This must include background, methods, results and conclusions

2) Citation line 20 is missing a year. 

3) Part 1 is too short. Add detailed literature search. Quaity and latest sources. Recent research. Part 2. Materials and methods in first two paragraphs must be part of the literature not the methodology. 

4) Abbreviations are not explained. 

5) Name on Table 1 is too long. Turn that into notes. 

6) Results are too brief.  You refer to Figure 1 and Figure 2 in appendices that are not marked. 

7) No conclusion. Discussion should include work of other authors.

8) References incorrectly formatted.  Each is different. 

9) Overall arrangement of the article is in appropriate. Unstructured. 

10) The defined aim or goal of the work is missing. This needs research questions or hypotheses. 

Review 2:

1) Specify the VAR model in text with the necessary equations

2) Confirm that there is no evidence of serial correlation in the residuals. 

3) Discuss the generalisation of the results of the study

4) Discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the study

5) Discuss the limitations of the study.
